# This section is used by the contrib module, Component Libraries. It allows you
# to reference .twig files in your sass/ directory by using the Twig namespace:
# @uwmbase
# component-libraries:
#   uwmbase:
#     paths:
#       - components
#       - templates


# This section lists the regions defined in Zen's default page.html.twig and
# maintenance-page.html.twig files. The name before the semi-colon is the
# machine name of the region. The text after the semi-colon is the region's
# description used on the admin/structure/block page.
#
# In the page.html.twig, the contents of the region are output with a
# {{page.MACHINE_NAME}} variable. For example, with these lines in the .info.yml
# file:
#   regions:
#     header_top: Header top
# You'll use this variable in page.html.twig:
#   {{ page.header_top }}

# regions:
#   header: Header
#   primary_menu: Primary menu
#   secondary_menu: Secondary menu
#   highlighted: Highlighted
#   breadcrumb: Breadcrumb
#   title: Title
#   help: Help
#   content: Content
#   sidebar_first: First sidebar
#   sidebar_second : Second sidebar
#   footer: Footer
#   bottom: Page bottom
#   # The page_top and page_bottom regions are hidden, which means they will not
#   # show up on the block layout page. But they are required in order for the
#   # html.html.twig to work properly, so do not delete them.
#   page_top: 'Page top'
#   page_bottom: 'Page bottom'
